# Resume Screener Application

## Overview

The **Resume Screener** is a Streamlit-based web application that automates the process of screening resumes against job descriptions. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate the similarity between resumes and job descriptions, provides a match percentage, and notifies selected candidates via email. The app offers a user-friendly interface with seamless document processing for PDF and DOCX files.

## Features

- **Document Parsing**: Supports PDF and DOCX resume files.
- **Job Description Matching**: Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity to assess resume relevance to the job description.
- **Automated Email Notification**: Notifies selected candidates with a personalized email.
- **Data Presentation**: Displays results in an interactive table format for quick evaluation.
- **Streamlit UI Customization**: Includes a sidebar navigation menu for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `docx2txt`: Extracts text from DOCX files.
  - `pdfplumber`: Extracts text from PDF files.
  - `scikit-learn`: Implements TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity.
  - `pandas`: Handles and displays data in tabular format.
- **SMTP (Email Automation)**: Sends personalized emails to shortlisted candidates.
- **Streamlit-Option-Menu**: Enhances navigation with a sidebar menu.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
